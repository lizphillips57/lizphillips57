				<h1>Liz Phillips</h1>
				
				<p><b>Liz Phillips (they/them)</b> is a Physics undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, minoring in Astronomy \& Planetary Science, and Media Arts \& Design. They are passionate about space exploration and science communication, and believe that art is an underutilized resource in teaching STEM topics. They seek to bridge the perceived gap between the arts and the physical sciences, a belief held both in academia and by the general public.</p>
				
				<p>Liz's art takes a dialectic approach to speculative fiction and the post-human condition. They believe that the journey is just as important, if not more so, than the destination. A good story is not just a beginning and an ending! In addition to imagining the philosophical implications of a post-human future, they explore the hypothetical processes and events through which such a future could realistically arrive. </p>
				
				<p>Liz is a leader for several student organizations:<br>
				<b>Editor-In-Chief/Managing Editor</b>, <a href="https://gauchomarks.com/">Gaucho Marks Magazine</a><br>
				<b>President</b>, UCSB Physics Discord<br>
				<b>Secretary</b>, <a href="http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~udip/">Undergraduate Diversity and Inclusion in Physics</a><br>
