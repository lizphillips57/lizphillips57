                <p>Mixed media, collage.</p>
                <p>This collage was created for the cover of Gaucho Marks Magazine's 2023 zine, which is free to read <a href="https://gauchomarks.com/2023/05/31/the-sedition-edition-spring-2023/">here<a></a>! It is made entirely out of ripped-up copies of old zines from previous years, UCSB recruitment pamphlets, and clippings from local newspapers containing the word "FREE". It features many easter eggs related to the Magazine's history.</p>
                <p>This was the first zine that Liz oversaw as Editor-In-Chief. As the sole remaining writer of the organization in 2022, the collage is meant to symbolize the reinvention of the club from the ground up, paying respects to the writers that came before. No matter how hard times get, the magazine will always be free to read, free to join, and embody freedom of the press.</p>
